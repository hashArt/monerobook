### Work In Progress

This project hasn't started yet (the official start is in September). I am going to make this project as accessible as possible for people without a technical background. In the best case you only have to worry about translating and editing.

# Translating Mastering Monero

Let's educate the world about blockchain and Monero. We want to translate the book into as many languages as possible.
I created a public [Telegram group](https://t.me/MasteringMoneroCommunity) that you can join to get in touch with the other translators (though there is only me right now).

## German Translation

I will work on a German translation in September. You are very welcome to join me. More details in September.

## Other Languages
If you want to translate the book into a different language feel free to add it to the list and submit a pull request.

## Languages

- English (100 %)
- German (0 %)
